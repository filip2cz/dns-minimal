Here are the files that you can use to make this VM image yourself. This is used, for example, to make it easy for me to promote versions of Alpine Linux.

## How to do it
1) Download and set up Alpine Linux (standard version): https://alpinelinux.org/downloads/
2) run the script setup.sh as root user (preferably in the root folder)  
you can use this command: `wget https://github.com/filip2cz/dns-minimal/raw/main/files/setup.sh && sh setup.sh`
